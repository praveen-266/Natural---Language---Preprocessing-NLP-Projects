# Natural Language Processing Works

## Overview
This repository showcases my works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes projects and applications where I have leveraged NLP techniques to extract insights, automate tasks, and improve text-based systems. This README.md file provides an overview of the key features, skills utilized, technologies used, and how to provide feedback or get in touch with me.

## Key Features
- Text Classification: I have implemented NLP models for various classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, and spam detection. These models enable automated analysis of text data and provide valuable insights.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): I have developed NER systems that identify and extract named entities from unstructured text, such as person names, organizations, locations, and more. These systems help in information extraction and entity linking.
- Text Summarization: I have created models that generate concise summaries of text documents, allowing users to quickly grasp the main ideas and key points without reading the entire content.
- Sentiment Analysis: I have built sentiment analysis models to determine the sentiment expressed in text, helping businesses gain insights into customer feedback, social media trends, and brand perception.

## Skills
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms.
- Text preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature engineering for NLP tasks.
- Machine learning and deep learning models for NLP.
- Evaluation and fine-tuning of NLP models.
- Understanding and handling text data in different languages.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language for NLP tasks.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A powerful library for NLP processing and analysis.
- spaCy: An industrial-strength NLP library for efficient text processing and NER.
- TensorFlow and PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training NLP models.
- Word2Vec and GloVe: Pretrained word embeddings for word representation.

## Feedback and Contact
I value feedback and suggestions regarding my NLP works. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to collaborate on NLP projects, please feel free to contact me.
